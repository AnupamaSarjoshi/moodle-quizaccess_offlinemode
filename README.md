# Experimental offline mode for the quiz

Well, not strictly offline, but designed to work even if the network connection
is unreliable.

This is currently work-in progress.
See [TODO.md](https://github.com/timhunt/moodle-quizaccess_offlinemode/blob/master/TODO.md)
and [MDL-47688](https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-47688) for details.


This plugin uses the following third-party libraries:

* The Stanford Javascript Crypto Library from https://github.com/bitwiseshiftleft/sjcl
* JSEncrypt https://github.com/travist/jsencrypt
